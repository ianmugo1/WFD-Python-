# Part A Implementation

This part of the project implements two Python classes:

- **House**  
  A class with attributes for house number, street, area, number of beds, and price. It includes methods to print these attributes and update each one with proper type checking.

- **Penthouse**  
  A subclass of House that adds extra attributes (floor number and whether it has a roof terrace). It provides its own print and update methods for these additional attributes.

This serves as the foundation for parts B and C of the project.
